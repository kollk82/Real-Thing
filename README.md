#The Real-Thing  
 All with Vue.js because i can...try :satisfied:  
 This is so cool :sunglasses: templates, router, transition some JS :sweat_smile:  
 I am using here all my skils from sass to js plus new thing I've learned from Vue.js documentation  
 This is a huge and time consuming project no idea about design initially.  
 Going with the flow.  
 Sketch it first.  
 What about the content :confused: Lorem :grin:  
 Single page app.    
 SEO will suffer No HTML content = no SEO :cold_sweat:

 * Back from work 😫 just pushing changes from few deys back to git. 
 * Issue with Scroll behavior on routers fixed with scrollBehavior function but didn't work with x, y  
   had to look arount for solution. Found it somewhere in comments that it could work with top, left  
   and it does work.  
 * Was going through Job adds and in one of them they where asking for Tailwindcss css framework.  
   Looked at docs and will do something with this over the weekend. 🙃
